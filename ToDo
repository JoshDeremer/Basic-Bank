The XML for GUIs is complete. Code is partially complete. Can navigate between frames, but functionally
not all buttons do what they are supposed to yet. Fillers put in place to simulate functionality. This 
will be fixed when we have data structure and storage taken care of.

ToDo:
- Account class (use the same as before?)
- How we will store data 
  - will we keep data within the program, or write to external file?
  - develop data storage code to write to XML file?
- Functional changes or additions to current GUI
- Aesthetic changes to current layout
